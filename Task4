Sum of Even numbers from 1 to 100?
Code:
public class EvenSum {  

    public static void main(String []args) {

        int n = 2;	
        int Sum = 0;
        while (n <= 100) {
            Sum += n;
            n += 2;
        }
        System.out.println(Sum);
    }
}
Logic Explanation:
Here we are going to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100. 
I took the initial number n=2 because 2 is the starting even number from 1 to 100.
We know that all numbers divided by 2 is even numbers so we are going to add 2 every time and adding 
the value to the current value of sum for every iteration we iterate up to the value n<=100.
Then we are going to stop the iteration and returns the sum and printing the value of sum.
